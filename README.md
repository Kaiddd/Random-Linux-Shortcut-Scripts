# upkg
An Arch and pip package updater.

Made for myself, to save me some typing, as well as to automatically update py packages haha.

***(Don't run as root)***

How to use:

Method 1 (**Recommended**)
Clone the repository (git clone https://github.com/Kaiddd/upkg.git)
CD into the folder (cd upkg)
Make the script executable (chmod +x upkg.py)
Move it into /usr/bin while removing the extension (mv upkg.py /usr/bin/upkg)
Simply run the command "upkg" to run the script :)
