## Just a random collection of throwaway scripts I've made to save me some typing, probably could've coded these better, fight me!

upkg - Python package updater, also runs pacman -Syu, lets me quickly update my whole system

fcopy - Copies a file's contents to your clipboard (Requires xclip)

targz - Extracts tar gunzip (tar.gz) files, simply runs tar xzvf on the provided file (I didn't want to remember "xzvf" nor did I want to type it every time I had to extact a tgz file...)
